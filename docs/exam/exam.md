# Exams

## Objective

Test students on course material through the application of Python programming skills to an analytics problem.

## Analytics problem design principles

- The exercises should be individual steps in solving a larger analytics problem.
- The analysis problem should be generally understandable and relatable for most students.
- The exam language should be carefully chosen so that pre-exiting knowledge of the topic is neither required nor provides a significant advantage.
  > This does not mean that an exam can't cover topics which some students know better than others. Such a topic doesn't exist. Appropriate context and formulas must be provided such that exercises can be solved without pre-existing knowledge. Any topic-specific concepts/terminlogy should be explained and/or have references provided. 
 
### Problem flow

#### 1. Exploration

- Access or read the data
- Understand the structure of the data
- Summarize the data

#### 2. Pre-processing

- Clean the data
- Parse, filter, slice/dice the data into required formats

#### 3. Analysis

- Implement an algorithm or fit a model to extract new information from the data

#### 4. Conclusions

- Use the analysis results to gain insight into the data

## Practical guidelines

- Aim for 7-10 exercises.
- Aim for 3.5-4 hour exam length.
- Exercises must be independent. Not solving one exercise should not block another.
- The first one or two exercises should be relatively easy compared to the rest.
- Limit the number of data structures the students must keep track of during the exam.
  > Humans can generally hold 7 +/-2 objects in short-term memory. We want to be safely below that.
