# Midterm 2

Midterm 2 is cumulative with a focus on the course material from modules 7-11. It is expected that students are familiar with the basics of Python, Pandas, Numpy, and SQL. 

## Rubric

For each high-level concept below include one moderate complexity (2-pt) exercise featuring that concept as the focus of the solution. The Pandas exercise should not be solvable with SQL, nor the SQL exercise solvable with Pandas.

### Midterm 1 material

- Basic Data Structures, Control Flow, String Parsing/Manipulation, Numeric Operations

### Pandas

- Create, compare, combine, and work with Pandas DataFrame, Series, and GroupBy objects
- Tabular data operations
  - groupby aggregations/apply
  - merge
  - sort
  - filter/replace values
  - melt/cast/pivot
  - data selection
  - manage metadata (columns, index)
  - mathematically derive columns
 
### SQL

- Basic SELECT syntax
- Filtering with WHERE and/or HAVING
- GROUP BY and aggregate functions
- Using JOINS to combine tables

> Note that this specifically does not include a way to use intermediate results such as CTE or subquery. If these are useful or necessary an explanation is needed.

### Numpy

- Implement mathematical formulas as code using arrays
  - including vector/matrix operations and broadcasting rules
- Sort or rank array elements
- Use aggregate functions/methods on arrays (across any axis)
