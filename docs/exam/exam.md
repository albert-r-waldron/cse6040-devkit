# Exams

## Objective

Test students on course material through the application of Python programming skills to an analytics problem.

## Expectations for students

#### 1. Problem solving

Given an exercise scenario with complex requirements, students are expected to put together a sequence of Python code to produce the expected result.  

The exercise requirements may suggest or require the student to use a Python module not yet covered in the course. Given a simple use case and sufficient guidance, students are expected to correctly use it in their solution.

#### 2. Data debugging

In the case that a student's solution executes but does not produce the expected result, students are expected to be able to use the provided feedback to correct their solution. In such cases the feedback will include the inputs, original values for inputs the student may have inadvertently changed, the expected result, and the result obtained from the student's solution.

## Analytics problem design principles

- The exercises should be individual steps in solving a larger analytics problem.
- The analysis problem should be generally understandable and relatable for most students.
- The exam language should be carefully chosen so that pre-exiting knowledge of the topic is neither required nor provides a significant advantage.
  > This does not mean that an exam can't cover topics which some students know better than others. Such a topic doesn't exist. Appropriate context and formulas must be provided such that exercises can be solved without pre-existing knowledge. Any topic-specific concepts/terminlogy should be explained and/or have references provided. 
 
### Problem flow

#### 1. Exploration

> Access/read the data, understand the structure of the data, summarize the data, etc.

#### 2. Pre-processing

> Clean the data, parse/filter/slice/dice the data, reformat the data, etc.

#### 3. Analysis

> Implement an algorithm or fit a model to extract new information from the data

#### 4. Conclusions

> Use the analysis results to gain insight into the data

## Practical guidelines

- Aim for 7-10 exercises.
- Aim for 3.5-4 hour exam length.
- Exercises must be independent. Not solving one exercise should not block another.
- The first one or two exercises should be relatively easy compared to the rest.
- Limit the number of data structures the students must keep track of during the exam.
  > Humans can generally hold 7 +/-2 objects in short-term memory. We want to be safely below that.
- Follow the exam specific design guidance: [Midterm 1](midterm-1.md), [Midterm 2](midterm-2), [Final Exam](final.md)
