# Midterm 1

Midterm 1 covers the course material from modules 0-5. It is expected that students are familiar with the basics of Python at this point in the course. 

## Rubric

For each high-level concept below include one moderate complexity (2-pt) exercise featuring that concept as the focus of the solution. 

### Python Data Structures

- Create and perform basic programming tasks with these data types: **str, int, bool, float**
- Create, compare, traverse, sort, and index/slice these collection data types: **list, tuple, set, dict (including defaultdict and Counter)**
- Work with nested collections

### Control Flow

- conditional branching (if, elif, else)
- loops (for, while)
- raising/handling errors
- functions
  - functions passed as arguments, defined in the startercode, or explained in the prompt
  - defining functions to reduce repetitive code
  - lambda functions to pass as arguments

### String Parsing and Manipulation

- Manipulation with string methods such as **join, upper/lower, replace**, etc
- Simple pattern matching with string methods
- Complex pattern matching with regular expressions
- Construct formatted strings

### Numeric operations

- Implement mathematical formulas as code
- Understands limitations of floating point precision
